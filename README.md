# React Router 5 Course Material

This course is not yet published (expected around May/June 2019) at https://courses.reacttraining.com/. Signup for our [Newsletter](https://reacttraining.com/newsletter/) if you want to be notified when the course is available.

In the mean time, feel free to explore this early version of the course material repo to see how I'm using React Router 5 to nest layouts in this Firebase-like design. If you see anything weird or broken just open an issue so I can fix it

If you're wondering what's new in React Router 5? Not a lot except internal optimizations and fixes for React 16.x. So you could also think of this as a React Router 4 course since the API is the same. [See more info on the React Router 5 release](https://reacttraining.com/blog/react-router-v5/)

This is not the real Firebase, this is what we're making:

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>
